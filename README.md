## Summary
Neural Network model trained on FIFA player datasets and recent results which 56% mean outcome prediction accuracy (60.2% peak). This accuracy is competitive and statistically higher than the proportion of BET365 bets which are correct to the final result. This report covers the full process of analysis, design and testing. The csv datasets are available in repository, the data was scraped from sofifa.com and soccerway.com.
